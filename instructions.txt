Initial analysis might be found in jupyter notebook: sentences_analysis.ipynb
to run it it is required to install jupyter-notebook.

Actual model developed during this project can be found in file: seq2seq.py
to run it:
download the data from: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/training-parallel-nc-v9.tgz
untar and place the data file (for english-german translation task) in data directory and rename them to: englishaa for english sentences and germanaa for german sentences.
then execute:
python seq2seq.py

After training in the working directory files with model, weights, logs and preprocessed data will be stored.

To visualize training identify the name of created by program folder: e.g. "logs3456286" and call: tensorboard --output_dir=logs3456286/

To restore trained model run file seq2seq_test.py:
python seq2seq_test.py
